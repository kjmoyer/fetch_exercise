# fetch_exercise
Synopsis:
This form takes in user input in free-form text input fields, and two drop downs whose options are being retrieved from the API listed below.

Styling:
As this exercise is for Fetch Rewards, the color scheme has been styled to match colors found on the Fetch Rewards website.

UX modifications:
The occupations received from the API appeared to not have any particular order, so the application will sort these alphabetically to make it easier for the user to find their desired selection.

Installation:
This application runs locally at port 3000.
Run the script `npm run dev` to launch `localhost:3000` in your local browser.
